# Boston-Bruins-Roster-Planning-MySQL-NoSQL

This project covers preparing a structured database (EER Diagram, UML Diagram, Relational database) followed by identifying the focus areas of the Bruins organization as our topic through the implementation of the database in SQL, NoSQL and Python in order to find the necessary information to make decisions for upcoming games.

The Bruins database designed on MySQL shows a concept of what the Bruins or any NHL organization could implement to track and analyze statistics throughout the season in order to make data driven decisions. The overall endstate would be to identify specific players to dress and to rest for certain games as well as identify a specific line pairing to be on the ice at a specific time. With the database the Bruins are able to determine if they can rest their top players by analyzing their upcoming opponent. They are able to find and take into account the opponentsâ€™ win percentage, how they have performed in past games and against the bruins as well as how many goals the bruins have scored on them as opposed to the goals they have scored on the Bruins. Additionally, the Bruins can put together an ideal line paring by finding the player with the most goals, the player with the most assists and the player with the most penalty minutes in order to have a goal scorer, someone to get him the puck and an enforcer to protect them. In the event of a power play the Bruins can find the players with the most power play goals and in the event of a close game towards the end of the third period the Bruins can find which of their players has the lowest production value in hopes of scoring a quick goal.

#The Data for this project was collected manually from ESPN and Bruins official website.#
